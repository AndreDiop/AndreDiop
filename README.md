### Hi there ðŸ‘‹<br/>
I'm Andre Diop, a Full Stack web developer from Atlanta. My passion for web development lies with the creation of ideas and making them come true with user intuitive interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.  

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Github Copilot, Python, Appian and Blueprism  
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects no matter how big or small.
